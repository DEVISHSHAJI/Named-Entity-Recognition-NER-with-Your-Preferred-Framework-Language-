##Project Title: Named Entity Recognition (NER) with [Your Preferred Framework/Language]
Overview:
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, etc., within text data. In this project, we'll build a NER model using [Your Preferred Framework/Language] and train it on a dataset to recognize named entities in text.

**Dataset**:
Select a suitable dataset for NER, such as the CoNLL-2003 dataset or any other dataset relevant to your domain. Ensure that the dataset includes labeled entities for training and evaluation.

**Project Structure**:
Data Preprocessing:

**Load the dataset**.
Preprocess the text data (tokenization, lowercasing, etc.).
Prepare the data for model training (convert words to indices, handle unknown words, etc.).
**Model Architecture**:

Choose a suitable architecture for NER, such as Bidirectional LSTM-CRF (Conditional Random Field) or Transformer-based models.
Implement the architecture using [Your Preferred Framework/Language].
Training:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the NER model using the training data.
Monitor the model's performance on the validation set and tune hyperparameters as necessary.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on the test set using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the model's performance using confusion matrices or other appropriate visualizations.
Inference:

Develop a function to perform NER on new text inputs using the trained model.
Demonstrate the model's ability to recognize named entities in unseen text data.
