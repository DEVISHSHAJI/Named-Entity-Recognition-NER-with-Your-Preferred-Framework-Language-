# Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BiLSTM Model

This repository contains code for training a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network. The model is trained on a custom dataset and implemented in Python using the spaCy library for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, and PyTorch for building and training the neural network.

## Introduction

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, etc. This project aims to train a NER model using a BiLSTM neural network architecture to recognize named entities in text data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ner-project.git
   cd ner-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install spacy torch pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format with two columns: "text" containing sentences and "labels" containing corresponding entity labels.
2. Replace the `data.csv` file in the repository with your dataset.
3. Run the `ner_project.py` script to train the model:
   ```
   python ner_project.py
   ```
4. The trained model will be saved as `ner_model.pth`.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the NER model should be prepared in CSV format with two columns: "text" containing sentences and "labels" containing corresponding entity labels. An example dataset is provided in `data.csv`.

## Model

The NER model is implemented using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network. The model architecture consists of an embedding layer, a BiLSTM layer, and a linear layer for classification.

## Training

The model is trained using the `ner_project.py` script. During training, the dataset is split into train and test sets. The model is trained using the train set and evaluated on the test set. Training parameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and optimizer can be modified in the script.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained model can be evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the model can be tested on new text data to perform Named Entity Recognition.
